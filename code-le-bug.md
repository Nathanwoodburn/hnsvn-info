# Code La Bug

Domail Email

Features:
- E2E encryption
- HNS resolution
- Sends to domain name not email?
  - Could be cool to allow for the same identity across other apps (eg. HNSChat)
- Allows for backup/restoration (could be good to allow users to change servers?)


Expectations
- User data security
  - E2E within the client
- User friendly
- Decentralized
